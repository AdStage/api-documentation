## Discovering Metrics

Developers will often need to discover various data fields to request and interpret their desired advertising data.
The following endpoints and documentation comprise comprehensive list of permitted options for advertising data fields.


Broadly, AdStage separates these fields into two categories: metrics and meta fields.
A field is stored as a metric if an advertising network allows AdStage to request the data as a daily timeseries (for example, `"clicks").
Metric fields are discoverable through the Metric Descriptor resource, which provides information about how to interpret and present the field (for example, by maintaining a list of networks supporting that metric).
In contrast, a field is stored as metadata if an advertising network only allows AdStage to request a single value for the data (for example, `"title"`).
Meta fields do not have associated rich descriptor resources at this time.
